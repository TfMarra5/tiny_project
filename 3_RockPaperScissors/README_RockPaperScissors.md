# ✂️ Rock Paper Scissors – Python Mini Game

A simple console-based **Rock Paper Scissors** game built in Python.  
This project is part of the **tiny_projects** collection — small programs made to practice logic and structure in a fun and fast way.

---

## 🎮 How it works

- Choose:
  - `R` → Rock
  - `P` → Paper
  - `S` → Scissors
  - `Q` → Quit the game
- The computer randomly selects its choice.
- The result (win, lose, tie) is shown for each round.
- The total score is displayed at the end, with a final winner message.

---

## 🧠 Concepts used

- `while True` loops
- input validation with `strip()` and `lower()`
- dictionaries for mapping letters → names
- `random.choice()` for computer decisions
- conditional logic (`if / elif / else`)
- f-strings for formatted output
- dynamic line formatting with `"=^"` for consistent width
