# 🎮 tiny_projects – Python mini games

This repository contains small Python projects made to practice programming logic in a simple, fast, and fun way.

The goal here is to **learn by building** — each mini-project is a step to improve logic, thinking, and confidence in coding.

## 🧠 Concepts used

* `if / elif / else`
* `while` loops  
* input validation (`strip()`, `lower()`, `continue`)  
* type conversion (`str` → `int`)  
* lists and dictionaries  
* `random.choice()` for randomness  
* formatted strings (f-strings)  
* clean console output and dynamic line formatting  

---

## ▶️ How to run

```bash
python3 file_name.py
```

Or navigate into the project folder you want to run:

```bash
cd 3_RockPaperScissors
python3 RockPaperScissors.py
```

## 🚀 Future ideas

* difficulty levels  
* attempt limits  
* score ranking  
* emoji versions (🪨📄✂️)  
* "play again" option without restarting the script  
* cross-project leaderboard
