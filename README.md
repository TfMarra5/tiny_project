# 🎮 tiny_projects - Python mini games

This repository gathers small Python projects created to practice
programming logic in a simple, fast, and fun way.

Each mini-project explores a different idea --- from games to utilities
--- helping build problem-solving skills, clean code habits, and
confidence through practical learning.
